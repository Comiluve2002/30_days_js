3. What is NaN in javascript? What is the type of NaN?
NaN is a property of the global object. In other words, it is a variable in global scope.
The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number â€” the same as the value of Number.NaN. In modern browsers,
NaN is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.
It is rather rare to use NaN in a program.
 
The type of NaN, which stands for Not a Number is, surprisingly, a number. The reason for this is, in computing,
NaN is actually technically a numeric data type. However, it is a numeric data type whose value cannot be represented
using actual numbers. So, the name "Not a Number", doesn't mean that the value is not numeric. It instead means that the
value cannot be expressed with numbers.
